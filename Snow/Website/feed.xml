&lt;p&gt;These outlets are controlled with a very simple protocol over ASK 433MHz RF. The protocol is documented pretty well &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, so I won't cover it in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months ago, I created an identical device using a Netduino 2 Pro, but it wasn't fast enough to handle the radio protocol, so I had to pair it with a second microprocessor (I used a TI Tiva C Launchpad). This iteration of the project was created to simplify my setup and to let me attach the device to my network via Wifi rather than wired ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create this device, I wired a TI CC3200 Launchpad to a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00INTI8R2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00INTI8R2&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=generi0c-20&amp;amp;linkId=IIDQZVD4UDU3VRI7"&gt;433MHz ASK transmitter&lt;/a&gt;. These transmitters are super simple - you have to supply 5v, ground, and a transmit signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the device was wired up, all it needed was some code. I used &lt;a href="https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient"&gt;knolleary/pubsubclient&lt;/a&gt; to communicate over MQTT. The application code is pretty simple - it subscribes to one topic and repeats any messages it receives over the RF link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I attempted to write the RF communications routine using the Energia supplied delay functions. Sadly, the microsecond delay function didn't work very well. When I measured the pulse timings with my logic analyzer, I saw that the delays were off, sometimes by a factor of 5x or more. Rather than troubleshoot a function I'm totally unfamiliar with, I took the easy way out - loop iteration based delays. With the help of my logic analyzer, I was easily able to create delays that perfectly matched my requirements. In a more complicated system, this wouldn't be a reasonable option, but this device is simple enough that it's not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've now been using this device for a few months and haven't had any issues with it. It's super reliable and can be hidden away anywhere USB power is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My code is available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/GeorgeHahn/MQTT_RF_Bridge"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; along with a wiring diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
CODE SAMPLE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, I wrote a library on top of M2MQTT. This library, GeorgeHahn\Charlotte, exposes a beautiful API to write against. Take a look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
PRETTY CODE SAMPLE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The library is pretty light, coming in at under XXX lines of C# code. It isn't mature, it may not be stable, and its codebase could use a fair bit of tweaking. That said, I'm currently using it to power a few parts of my home automation system and have had very few issues with it.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm now on my fifth or sixth try, and I believe I've found a durable solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first try involved supergluing steel balls to carbon fiber rods. It didn't take long for the balls to break off. When Haydn Huntley posted on the deltabots mailing list offering to sell balls machined with an attached ~1/2" of m3 thread, I immediately purchased some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/haydnballs.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threaded balls have the significant advantage of adjustability, but you need the right setup to be able to take advantage of it. My first threaded ball solution was to superglue m3 nuts onto my CF rods. As expected, it didn't work any better than supergluing directly to the steel balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/nut-epoxied-to-rod.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I bought some doublepack epoxy from Hardmann. (These are convenient foil bubblepacks of a standard 2 part epoxy. They're great for those of us who never need a whole tube of epoxy!) My first try, again, was to epoxy the nuts right to the ends of the CF rods. Again, this approach didn't work. After that, I tried setting threads in epoxy inside the CF rods. This worked reasonably well, but after some wear, the balls would start to wobble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/rod-internal-threads.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to my most recent and most successful attempt. It solves all of the issues I've had so far - ball stability, adhesive durability, and lack of adjustability. I designed a plastic part that would fit over a carbon fiber rod, giving a lot more surface area for the adhesive to bond with. Inside the plastic part, there is a spot for an integrated m3 nut. Since the nut is internal to the part and will be epoxied into place, ball stability is virtually guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

This weekend, I finally had the chance to play with it. One word - WOW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so the demo that ships with the board isn't really impressive. What is impressive, however, is the CC3200 IC on the board. This chip costs about $9 in 1k quantities and contains everything you need to build a wifi connected embedded system. If you're familiar with the previous CC3000 wifi module, this IC is very similar, except it comes as a 64 pin QFN and includes an ARM Cortex-M4 applications processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't had the chance to get Energia up and running with the CC3200 yet; I'm holding off until they ship a stable version with CC3200 support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I haven't actually worked with this chip, I can't really give it a recommendation. Still, if you're designing a cost sensitive product that needs wifi connectivity, you would be crazy to leave this chip out of your evaluation list.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a problem when apps tell windows they support high DPI but then go on to render at exactly the same size - making for unreadable text and unclickable buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried editing the application's manifest to set DpiAware to false, but that had no effect. Rather than switch my laptop's resolution every time I needed to use Cadence OrCAD, I did a little debugging with Ollydbg. Turns out, at some point, &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633543%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"&gt;SetProcessDPIAware&lt;/a&gt; is called. I already had an idea on how to solve it, so I didn't stick around to find the offending library (though I suspect it was being set by gdiplus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably could have patched OrCAD (less so gdiplus), but there is a far more flexible solution. All we need to do is hook the SetProcessDPIAware function as a program is starting, and we gain the ability to block the function call, leaving the target application no way to tell windows not to scale it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href="https://github.com/RaMMicHaeL/minhook"&gt;minhook&lt;/a&gt; library to build a DLL that will do just that. When it is loaded by an application, the code replaces SetProcessDPIAware with an implementation that does nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DLL must be present right as the app is initializing, else it won't be able to block the function call. Rather than inject the DLL per se, I just used CFF Explorer to add it to the misbehaving application's import table. This causes it to be loaded as the application is starting up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain Windows 8 compatibility, I didn't hook &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn302122%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"&gt;SetProcessDpiAwareness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Using the tool&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use DPIMangler yourself, get the &lt;a href="https://github.com/GeorgeHahn/DPIMangler/releases/tag/v1.0.0"&gt;binaries here&lt;/a&gt;. Next, get &lt;a href="http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php"&gt;CFF Explorer&lt;/a&gt; or a similar tool. Open the target executable in CFF Explorer, go to the Import Adder, and click Add. Select the appropriate DPIMangler binary, then choose any exported function and click Import By Name. Next, click Rebuild Import Table and save the application. That's it! Next time you run the program, calls to SetProcessDPIAware will be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this isn't working for you, make sure the application doesn't declare DpiAware in its manifest. Additionally, it's possible the program is calling SetProcessDPIAwareness, which I haven't hooked here. If that's the case, feel free to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/George_Hahn/"&gt;contact me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and I'll try to get a new release out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before; OrCAD on high DPI is practically unusable with no scaling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/OrCADNoScaling.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After; much more usable with forced scaling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, my roommate texted me a picture of a sign that her work was going to throw out. When she got home, I convinced her that we should go and retrieve it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we removed the letter faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/can-letter-faces.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the faces free, we removed the screws that were holding the letters to their bulky mounting rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/can-letter-removal.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letters free from the rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/can-letters-freed.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were surprised to find that the letters were lit with neon. We removed the bulbs and placed them aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/can-letters-removed-neon.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning home, we cleaned the letters and lined them up to prepare for lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/can-letters-lined-up.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then stuffed the letters with string lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/can-letters-more-lights.jpg" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/can-letters-inserting-lights.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letters in place above our kitchen cabinets. We were lucky they fit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.genericmaker.com/images/can-letters-in-place.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fun diversion for today, but we'll probably have to redo them with LEDs if we decide to keep them around for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like this spontaneous bit of work, you should see what my roommate does over at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaserTrees"&gt;Electric Trees&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
