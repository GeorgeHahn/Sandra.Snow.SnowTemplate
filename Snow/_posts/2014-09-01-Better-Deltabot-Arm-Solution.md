title: Better Deltabot Arm Solution

I've spent the last few months experimenting with magnetic ball joints on my mini kossel-cerberus pup mashup. I'm now on my fifth or sixth try, and I believe I've found a durable solution.

My first try involved supergluing steel balls to carbon fiber rods. It didn't take long for the balls to break off. When Haydn Huntley posted on the deltabots mailing list offering to sell balls machined with an attached ~1/2" of m3 thread, I immediately purchased some.

The threaded balls have the significant advantage of adjustability, but you need the right setup to be able to take advantage of it. My first threaded ball solution was to superglue m3 nuts onto my CF rods. As expected, it didn't work any better than supergluing directly to the steel balls.

Next, I bought some doublepack epoxy from Hardmann. (These are convenient foil bubblepacks of a standard 2 part epoxy. They're great for those of us who never need a whole tube of epoxy!) My first try, again, was to epoxy the nuts right to the ends of the CF rods. Again, this approach didn't work. After that, I tried setting threads in epoxy inside the CF rods. This worked reasonably well, but after some wear, the balls would start to wobble.

This brings me to my most recent and most successful attempt. It solves all of the issues I've had so far - ball stability, adhesive durability, and lack of adjustability. I designed a plastic part that would fit over a carbon fiber rod, giving a lot more surface area for the adhesive to bond with. Inside the plastic part, there is a spot for an integrated m3 nut. Since the nut is internal to the part and will be epoxied into place, ball stability is virtually guaranteed.
