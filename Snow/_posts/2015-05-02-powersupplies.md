For my purposes, must have a cardedge connector

Primary: HP PS3381-1C1 - 12V@32A, 5V@5A [post](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=14205992&postcount=7)

I've been using one of these for a few months on my Mini Kossel without any issues. It handles a 40W cartridge heater and a 120W heated bed with ease. The fan is noisy, but it could be worse. Can be had for $10 shipped!

Other options:

- Dell NPS330BB A - 12V@18A, 5V@35A, 3.3V@10A [post](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1382457&highlight=nps330bb) Looks like a great LED PSU!
