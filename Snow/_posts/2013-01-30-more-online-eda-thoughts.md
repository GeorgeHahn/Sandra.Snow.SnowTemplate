Some little annoyances I came up with as I was drawing out a simple Micro USB breakout board.
#Upverter

-     A layout measurement tool would help while drawing part footprints
-     Can't set default part prefix when creating/editing a part
-     The part update notification is great, but could use some ironing

-     Footprint rotation is in radians? Seriously?
-     No way to edit text in layout
-     Can't put text on a copper layer
-     Tooltips can really get in your way (a problem when you're zoomed in on a layout)
-     Orders allow negative qty all the way up until order submission
-     **Credit card details are saved without any permission (not okay!)**
-     What's with the project urls? http://upverter.com/GeorgeHahn/**3d6ead6de4b3dbee**/MicroUSB-Breakout-Board/

#Circuits.IO

-     **Footprint creation is <s>clunky</s> terrifying** (bad enough I didn't even try to finish making my part).
-     On the schematic symbol editor (http://www.circuits.io/schematic_symbols/1202/edit), the user as asked to enter a 'coma-separated list' **comma**.
-     Schematic symbol page shows a hex number for the user: `#<User:0x00000009b39c60`>
