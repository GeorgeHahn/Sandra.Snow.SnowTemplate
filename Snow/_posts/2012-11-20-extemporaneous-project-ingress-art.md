Making some original #ingress art 

![][0]

Started out with some fairly rough sand paper.

Fine grit sandpaper and a pane of glass for a shiny finish.

Sanded the heat spreader down to copper.

See where I'm going with this?

Drew the desired pattern on the processor with a wax crayon.

Warning: electroplating with lead solder is probably a really bad idea.

The wax didn't stop the plating well enough, so I made the design stand out with a bit of sanding.
