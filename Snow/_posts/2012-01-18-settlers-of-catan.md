I have been a [Settlers of Catan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan) addict for the past two years. If you enjoy board games and you have not had the chance to play this one, you are really missing out.

Long ago, I lost one of the white settlements. As I now own a functional 3d printer, I thought I might print a replacement. When I found that someone had already uploaded models of the [Catan settlements, cities, and roads](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:770) to thingiverse, I decided to print an entire set of pieces.

This was my first print in two weeks. Not long ago, I switched to grey plastic and found its thermal properties different from the transparent blue plastic I am used to. I had to recalibrate a number of settings, and my prints still have not reached the level of quality I would like to see. Once I have reached a higher level of quality, I will reprint this set. In the meantime, it is definitely suitable for use.
