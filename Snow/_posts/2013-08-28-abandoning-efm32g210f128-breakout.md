title: Abandoning the EFM32G210F128 Breakout 
---

I'm officially abandoning my Energy Micro EFM32G210F128 breakout. The design files are all on Upverter and are released into the public domain.

Energy Micro has microprocessors with native USB, so there's no reason for me to continue working on a design that needs an expensive USB-UART converter. This is a straightforward case of subpar research and some flawed reasoning coming to bite after the design work has been completed.
