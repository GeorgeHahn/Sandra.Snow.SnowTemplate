title: The Roles of Professors

This is an assignment I wrote for my "Intro to Engineering" class. 

## Reflection: Important Roles for Professors

I disagree with three of seven items shown on the list of important roles for professors. Here's what I disagree with and why.

*Give you the benefit of the doubt on a borderline grade*

I am a student, not a case for charity. If my professor feels I deserve the higher of two grades, fine, I'll take it, and I'll appreciate it. In the end, though, I really don't care what they do. All I value is that my grade represents an objective view of my proficiency in a subject and the effort I put in. If a professor grades hard, that's not an issue with the professor, that's an issue with my proficiency.

*Monitor your progress and hold you accountable for your performance*

I am a student, I can take care of myself. I don't need a figure of responsibility to hold my hand throughout the learning process. Like I said before, all I ask from my professors is that my grade be representative of my skill in the subject they are teaching.
 
*Nominate you for scholarships or academic awards*

I am a student, I have to pay for my own schooling. Applying for scholarship and other excellence-based awards is my job, not my professors'.

Now that I am thoroughly offended by this list, I suppose I might share the four things I do appreciate from a professor. *Provide you with invaluable one-on-one instruction. Give you academic advising, career guidance, <s>and personal advice</s>. <s>Help you find a summer job in industry and even</s> hire you on their research grants. Serve as a valuable reference when you apply for jobs, either while you are a student or after you graduate. Perhaps I was wrong to claim I agreed with four of the items. Two and two halves is more accurate.*

*Studying Engineering*, by Raymond B. Landis has some helpful content and useful bits of common sense - this is not one of them.
