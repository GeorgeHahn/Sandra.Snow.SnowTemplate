        <span>posted on 02 Apr 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>About four months ago, I came across the <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/pcm2707">TI PCM2707</a>. The PCM2707 is a standard USB 1.1 audio IC. As such, it can play audio without any custom drivers. My device closely follows the reference design shown in TI's datasheet. The PCM2707 can play 16 bit stereo audio at a maximum sampling rate of 48kHz. It has a built in 175mW headphone amplifier for analog output. Additionally, it can output S/PDIF and I2S digital audio. The former might be used to connect to a consumer audio receiver, while the latter could be used to interface with a more powerful amplifier IC.</p>

<p>The PCM2707 has a built in 3.3 volt regulator. I was tempted to use this regulator's output to power a separate headphone amplifier, but TI specifically warns against this. Doing so would probably risk blowing the built in regulator or going over USB's 500mA current limit. As I'm not a fan of toasting $10 chips, I opted to stay with the reference design.</p>

<p>The PCM2707 was brought to market in 2003. While it offers simplicity, it sacrifices a number of attractive features present in modern USB audio devices. The USB 1.1 audio standard has provisions for stereo audio at a bit depth of 16 and a sampling rate of up to 48kHz. If you want more, you need a custom driver. Any of these features is likely to require more bandwidth than USB 1.1 can offer, so you probably need a USB 2.0 device, too. As far as I am aware, there is no USB 2.0 equivalent to the PCM2707 on the market - all solutions seem to be based around a processor with a USB hardware interface and a DAC. I didn't want to bother with an unfamiliar MCU, custom drivers, and expensive development kits - so I picked the dinosaur.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>I did not need any exceptional features, so I opted to use TI's reference design. I copied the schematic into OrCAD and broke out the lines that looked interesting. From OrCAD, I exported a netlist to PADS for hardware layout. (To glue the two pieces of software together, I used the <a href="http://pcbstandards.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2247">PowerNET</a> netlister.) This workflow was painful to set up, but very efficient once it was operational. I opted to use these two software packages over Eagle because my coworkers are familiar with them.</p>

<p>The layout was scrapped three times before I arrived at my final design - I planned to buy boards from BatchPCB, so I foolishly forced my design into one square inch. By the time I was done carving bits from my design, I had a haphazardly placed double sided board with no access to a number of useful pins. For the first layout iteration, I hand placed all components and hand routed all traces. For the subsequent layouts, I kept the hand placement and autorouted the traces. This saved neither time nor effort - I spent so much time tweaking and optimizing the traces that it would have been faster to route them manually.</p>

<p>In my final design, all resistors and ceramic capacitors are 0603 size. I like 0603 because it offers a good compromise between size and hand-solderability.</p>

<p><img src="/images/usbdac-barepcb.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>

<p>When the boards arrived, I performed a quick inspection. BatchPCB's board house had put the silkscreen for both sides on the top! Additionally, the soldermask was thin and uneven. I wasn't too happy - nonetheless, I hurriedly assembled one and plugged it into a USB port. The PCM2707 on-board promptly let out its magical smoke. After a few hours spent debugging, I determined that my USB footprint was numbered backwards and the data lines were swapped. After soldering a USB cable directly to my board, everything worked as expected.</p>

<p><img src="/images/usbdac-during-debugging.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once I was satisfied that nothing would spontaneously explode, I printed a small case with my reprap. Because I failed to add mounting holes to my PCB, I designed a case that would contact the perimeter of the PCB while avoiding any nearby components. To help avoid any mistakes, I modeled the assembled part and built a box around it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/DACCase.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The four small pins visible in the above rendering did not print correctly, so I glued the two halves together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/usbdac-in-case.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>This little guy sounds great! The "low res" audio sounds stellar on everything from my pair of Sony MDR-V500s to my friend's Sennheiser HD555s. The device is absolutely silent when no audio is playing. It delivers clean mids and highs and a reasonable amount of bass.</p>

<h2>Mistakes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Micro USB connector on a prototype</li>
<li>Components right next to the edge of the PCB</li>
<li>Components on both sides of the PCB</li>
<li>Autorouted traces</li>
<li>Minimum size traces (6mil)</li>
<li>No locating holes or cutouts</li>
<li>No revision letter (or number)</li>
<li>Ordered a lot of PCBs to 'make up for' the BatchPCB setup fee</li>
</ul>

<p>In the future, I will use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mini USB</li>
<li>0.1" edge clearance for all non-connector components</li>
<li>Components on one side</li>
<li>Larger traces</li>
<li>Manual routing</li>
<li>Locating holes</li>
<li><a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order">DorkbotPDX</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Added 4/7/2012</em></p>

<p>I found another bug - the channels are swapped! This issue would be tough to fix by cutting traces, so I solved it by flipping the 3.5mm jack upside-down and wiring its pins to the proper pads. This is fixed in rev B - the files for which will be up as soon as I have verified their integrity.</p>

      </h1> 
      
      <p>During my recent foray into PCB layout, I made a few mistakes. Here are the most egregious:</p>

<p>The biggest mistake I made was starting to route traces before I was happy with part placement. I can't stress this enough, <strong>figure out your part placement before you start routing</strong>. Of course, if you have an autorouter available, it is acceptable to use it periodically to gauge your part placement.</p>

<p><strong>Nail down your schematic before you start laying out your board.</strong> If your schematic is a moving target, layout will be impossible.</p>

<p><strong>If you know you are going to need small parts, use them from the start.</strong> On my first design, I started with 0805 passives and had to switch to 0603's when I realized I wasn't going to be able to pack 0805's as tightly as I wanted to. I scrapped the entire 0805 based layout and started from scratch with 0603 parts.</p>

<p><strong>Take it one step at a time.</strong> I may have made this point already, but it is important enough to warrant restating. Do not start placing parts until your schematic is done. Do not start routing traces until you are happy with part placement. Do not write a BOM until your PCB is complete.</p>

<p><strong>It is a good idea to know the approximate price of parts you are using.</strong> If you use prohibitively expensive or unavailable parts on your design, you may have to make changes as far back as the schematic. Essentially, you may have to make changes to every single step. Save yourself the frustration and know the parts you use. </p>

      <p>Recently, I created a bare-bones design for TI's <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/pcm2707">PCM2707</a> USB DAC. This was the first time I designed a board layout. It was enlightening, to say the least. The board is almost entirely surface mount and comes in at a hair over 1 sq inch. I have five of them on order at BatchPCB - I'll share the schematic and layout for this one once I get a chance to play with the hardware.</p>

<p>Once the basic board works, I would like to make two derivatives - one bus powered with a headphone amplifier, and one self powered with a heftier amplifier. I have not decided on a specific amplifiers yet, but I am considering the 25 watt <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/tas5713">TAS5713</a> for the board with the bigger amp. This chip sings from an I2S input, which should help keep a short analog signal path. </p>

      <p>I have been a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan">Settlers of Catan</a> addict for the past two years. If you enjoy board games and you have not had the chance to play this one, you are really missing out.</p>

<p>Long ago, I lost one of the white settlements. As I now own a functional 3d printer, I thought I might print a replacement. When I found that someone had already uploaded models of the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:770">Catan settlements, cities, and roads</a> to thingiverse, I decided to print an entire set of pieces.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012-01-17_01-20-32_503.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This was my first print in two weeks. Not long ago, I switched to grey plastic and found its thermal properties different from the transparent blue plastic I am used to. I had to recalibrate a number of settings, and my prints still have not reached the level of quality I would like to see. Once I have reached a higher level of quality, I will reprint this set. In the meantime, it is definitely suitable for use. </p>

      <p>It has been a while since my last post - a long while. I have been keeping busy, though! My reprap is now compete and is printing parts of remarkable quality. Recently, I modded a tiny zotac nettop with a large 12v fan. The mod was far from straightforward, so I plan to document it for the benefit of anyone else whose stock fan dies. In the meantime, I have been working on a website to help students study organic chemistry. Right now, the public site is feature frozen while I develop version 2, a complete rewrite. I wish it were not necessary, but the first version was procedural PHP backed only by a simple XML file. Quick and easy, perhaps, but not maintainable! Version 2 will use the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/">YII framework</a> and will open the door to some really nice features in the future. You can see the first version at <a href="http://www.studyorganic.com/">www.StudyOrganic.com</a></p>

      <p>I have been spending some time on the #reprap IRC channel lately, and there seems to be some demand for an on-printer user interface. When I first heard this, I was ecstatic - my company once produced an aftermarket iPod interface for automotive use. This interface allowed the user to control their music with a four button + 16x2 LCD module. Now that most aftermarket head units come with iPod control built in, there is no demand for our product. As such, we have a large quantity of these modules and very little use for them.</p>

<p>After realizing this opportunity, I began testing a module to verify the protocol spec. After hours of beating my head against an invisible protocol wall, I realized my FDTI USB-serial cable wasn't providing enough current. I moved the power and ground lines to a 13.8V supply, and BAM, text!</p>

<p>Pending permission from my employer, I will release the protocol specification and device schematics.</p>
