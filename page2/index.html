<p>I'm officially abandoning my Energy Micro EFM32G210F128 breakout. The design files are all on Upverter and are released into the public domain.</p>

<p>Energy Micro has microprocessors with native USB, so there's no reason for me to continue working on a design that needs an expensive USB-UART converter. This is a straightforward case of subpar research and some flawed reasoning coming to bite after the design work has been completed.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week, I returned from an eight day visit to Toronto, Ontario. I'm from rural New Jersey and, though there are some 'population centers' near me, there isn't anything like a three million person city.</p>

<p>In some ways, the visit was scary - this was the first time I've ever heard someone get mugged. We ran outside to see what was going on, but there wasn't anyone around. We didn't know what had happened until the police stopped by later to ask questions. Yikes, that's new.</p>

<p>At the same time, the visit was an amazing experience. The amount of things going on in the city is outstanding. I've never seen a spectacle quite like the Pride parade, nor have I slept in a house so close to a city block full of shops, coffeehouses and interesting people.</p>

<p>Alright, so I didn't meet many people outside Upverter and friends. I plan to though! That's where my apprehension comes in - I'm a quiet, introverted guy. I stumble over my words sometimes, and I get pretty nervous when more than two people I don't know are listening to me. Giving knowledge, opinions, and speculations to others - using your voice - is one of the most profound facets of the human experience, but it scares the hell out of me.</p>

<p>I can't say why. Maybe it's because my smoker voice sounds funny. Perhaps it's that I get too distracted trying to pick the right words to keep speaking. I don't really know, but I really don't care. I don't need to understand why I'm bad at socializing to become better at it. Not really.</p>

<p>I'm going to become a better socializer by tour-de-force. I'm usually the type to grab a book and analyze every passage in an effort to absorb every last bit of information. Not this time - sure, I've done some reading about socializing and such, but I know enough to know I need to approach this problem from a different angle - I need to put myself right in the middle of situations I know I won't be comfortable in, because that's what it's going to take. Sure, I could read all about my problems, but no amount of reading is going to teach me to think on my feet. Nothing I read will help me remember the helpful little facts I wish I could contribute to a conversation. Nothing at all, except for braving the weather and surviving the storm.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

        <span>posted on 08 May 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p><em>Term paper for a generic Intro to Engineering class.</em></p>

<p>Should I be an engineer? Surely this is a question every student wrestles with at some point. Many who ask it may decide not to become engineers. While it may be a tough decision for some, it's a given for me. I love designing, analyzing, building, and testing systems. I thrive on tough situations – there's nothing that gets my brain going quite like a malfunctioning circuit or a buggy piece of software.</p>

<p>I embarked on the path to becoming an engineer early in life. It began with taking things apart – as a child, I would disassemble anything I was given the chance to. At eleven, I completely disassembled the old laptop my dad had given me so I could replace a noisy fan. When I put it back together, the fan had been silenced and my laptop was lighter by a couple of screws – but it still worked!</p>

<p>I owe much of my inspiration in recent years to my past – and only – employer. An entrepreneur and engineer himself, he once told me that he used to have a keen interest in bird watching. Once he knew all of the birds in his area, he got bored and moved on to electronics. He hasn't gotten bored yet. I have never had an interest in bird watching, but I certainly have never gotten bored with engineering.</p>

<p>My boss also taught me the importance of moving the status quo. When I started working at his company, I was given the freedom to work on a number of extremely interesting projects. As time went on, rather than working on important projects that would have an impact on our industry, my time was spent on menial projects that were barely related to my area of interest. When I proposed new projects that would move the company forward and set them up to have products to sell in ten years, they were shot down for being too ambitious, too complicated, or too expensive. When I quit four months ago, the company was scrambling to piece together a prototype that was strikingly similar to something I proposed almost two years before. They were hopelessly behind the industry and will release one or two product iterations that are painfully expensive and time consuming. Even then, they'll probably never catch up. The lesson I learned: move early. If you wait for the market to tell you what to do, you'll always be behind. Sometimes you can succeed by fulfilling a market's obvious demands, but to truly make a difference you have to be the one who reads the cards and takes the market to the next level.</p>

<p>A desire to move the status quo is why I'm hoping to intern at Upverter in the coming months. They're a small Candadian startup doing work in the electronic design automation (EDA) space. While the product they're creating isn't essential yet, it has the potential to change how we design and test electronic systems. This is no easy goal, but for something that could transform the EDA market before this decade is out, it's worth the effort.</p>

<p>Engineering is not for everyone, but it is everything for me. I find engineering intriguing, exciting and fulfilling. If I have changed the world by the time I die, I will rest easily. I do not ask to be remembered and I care little if my name stays around, but I want to leave the world a better place than it was when I entered it.</p>

        <span>posted on 02 May 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Intro to Engineering courses are a necessity.</p>

<p>Most Intro to Engineering courses are useless.</p>

<p>Intro to Engineering courses exist to help engineering students get a job after college; to help students bridge the gap between academia and a career. The problem with these intro courses is that they can't evolve quickly enough. Engineering is changing, but the courses haven't caught up.</p>

<p>Now, here's how we can fix them:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stop using the old textbooks.</strong> I don't care who wrote it or when it was written, an Intro to Engineering course shouldn't focus on one text.</li>
<li><strong>Start using social media.</strong> Assignment idea: Have students contact someone in the industry that they respect with as many questions as they can fit within a tweet. Of course, allow those without Twitter accounts to attempt an email contact.
<ul>
<li><strong>Contacts are everything</strong>, right? Teach students how contacts are made in the modern world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Industry mags and blog posts from experts are important.</strong> If a class must contain 'summarize and respond' assignments, let students pick articles or posts they care about. The quality of their responses will instantly improve. </li>
<li><strong>Presentations are important, powerpoint is not.</strong> Don't put artificial slide count requirements on presentations, this only reduces the number of good slides in a presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on solo presentations.</strong> There are times when presentations must be given as a group. Even so, when learning public speaking, working as a group can be extremely stressful and provides little return. Don't force students to work with a group, especially on their first few presentations.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>PS: I'll write a post detailing what was wrong with the Intro to Engineering course that I took later on. I am publishing this post first because I'd rather focus on things that can be improved rather than rag on things that are broken.</em></p>

      <p>Yesterday, I replaced the LMDE entries in my sources.list with entries for Debian Testing. Then I ran a dist-upgrade.</p>

<pre><code>685 upgraded, 10 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 581 MB of archives.
After this operation, 32.8 MB disk space will be freed.
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure exactly how long the process took, but it was done within a couple hours. When I came back to my laptop, all text was invisible. This problem went away after a reboot.</p>

<p>I haven't removed all installed mint packages yet, and I plan to stay with Cinnamon. As such, everything feels quite the same. In fact, I'd have a hard time pointing out any changes at all. The only significant thing I've gained from this endeavor is the knowledge that my packages will now be more up to date. </p>

      <p>Linux Mint Debian Edition is built on Debian Testing. After months of dealing with flaky mirrors and a not-so-impressive distro, I decided it was time to flip the switch. (Other than Cinnamon and/or MATE, Mint doesn't offer much.)</p>

<p>I am going to attempt to perform an in-place switch by modifying my sources.list. We'll see how it turns out - either it will work, or I'll be installing Debian Testing later tonight.</p>

<p>I generated a new sources.list from <a href="http://debgen.simplylinux.ch/">http://debgen.simplylinux.ch/</a>.</p>

<p>Old sources.list:</p>

<pre><code>deb http://packages.linuxmint.com/ debian main upstream import

      <p><a href="http://upverter.com/">Upverter</a> is the best online circuit creation platform, and OSHPark is one of the best circuit board production services. Put the two together, and you should find bliss - but you won't. Anyone who has had an Upverter-designed board built by OSHPark will be familiar with this problem. When you download gerbers from Upverter, you get a zip full of files like bottom<em>copper.ger and top</em>paste.ger. OSHPark, on the other hand, wants names like Bottom Layer.ger and Board Outline.ger.</p>

<p>Here are the name transformations - each pair consists of the Upverter name followed by the OSHPark name. If a file isn't listed here, it should not be uploaded to OSHPark.</p>

<pre><code>var filepairs = new TupleList&lt;string, string&gt;
{
 { "layers.cfg", "layers.cfg" },
 { "hole.ger", "Drills.xln" },
 { "mechanical_details.ger", "Board Outline.ger" },

 { "top_copper.ger", "Top Layer.ger" },
 { "top_silkscreen.ger", "Top Silk Screen.ger" },
 { "top_solder_mask.ger", "Top Solder Mask.ger" },

 { "bottom_copper.ger", "Bottom Layer.ger" },
 { "bottom_silkscreen.ger", "Bottom Silk Screen.ger" },
 { "bottom_solder_mask.ger", "Bottom Solder Mask.ger" }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote a quick C# command line app to do the transformation automatically. If you drop a Upverter zip onto the app, it will create an <em>osh_</em> zipfile using the OSHPark naming conventions.</p>

<p>You can find the source and the binary at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/George_Hahn/upvertertooshpark">https://bitbucket.org/George_Hahn/upvertertooshpark</a>.</p>

<p>BONUS: Create a shortcut to the binary in the <code>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo</code> directory! This will allow you to right click on an Upverter zip and choose Send to: OSHPark!</p>

        <span>posted on 03 Mar 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>This is an assignment I wrote for my "Intro to Engineering" class. </p>

<h2>Reflection: Important Roles for Professors</h2>

<p>I disagree with three of seven items shown on the list of important roles for professors. Here's what I disagree with and why.</p>

<p><em>Give you the benefit of the doubt on a borderline grade</em></p>

<p>I am a student, not a case for charity. If my professor feels I deserve the higher of two grades, fine, I'll take it, and I'll appreciate it. In the end, though, I really don't care what they do. All I value is that my grade represents an objective view of my proficiency in a subject and the effort I put in. If a professor grades hard, that's not an issue with the professor, that's an issue with my proficiency.</p>

<p><em>Monitor your progress and hold you accountable for your performance</em></p>

<p>I am a student, I can take care of myself. I don't need a figure of responsibility to hold my hand throughout the learning process. Like I said before, all I ask from my professors is that my grade be representative of my skill in the subject they are teaching.</p>

<p><em>Nominate you for scholarships or academic awards</em></p>

<p>I am a student, I have to pay for my own schooling. Applying for scholarship and other excellence-based awards is my job, not my professors'.</p>

<p>Now that I am thoroughly offended by this list, I suppose I might share the four things I do appreciate from a professor. <em>Provide you with invaluable one-on-one instruction. Give you academic advising, career guidance, <s>and personal advice</s>. <s>Help you find a summer job in industry and even</s> hire you on their research grants. Serve as a valuable reference when you apply for jobs, either while you are a student or after you graduate. Perhaps I was wrong to claim I agreed with four of the items. Two and two halves is more accurate.</em></p>

      <p>Late last month, I designed a simple micro USB breakout board on Upverter. I would have bought Sparkfun's breakout, but it does not expose the ID pin - which I needed. I ordered the tiny PCB from OSH Park, but the design <a href="http://upverter.com/GeorgeHahn/3d6ead6de4b3dbee/MicroUSB-Breakout-Board/">is available here</a> for anyone who wants to have it built themselves. Note that you'll need to rename the gerbers from Upverter's naming scheme to OSH Park's.</p>

<p><img src="/images/usb_breakout.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since I have a number of micro USB connectors and some extra boards, I decided to list the board on Tindie. If you happen to need a Micro USB connector with all of the pins broken out, you know where to get it! Since you're awesome and read this post, here's a discount code for $1.00 off: ADF6EE7.

      <p>Some little annoyances I came up with as I was drawing out a simple Micro USB breakout board.</p>

<h1>Upverter</h1>

<ul>
<li>A layout measurement tool would help while drawing part footprints</li>
<li>Can't set default part prefix when creating/editing a part</li>
<li>The part update notification is great, but could use some ironing</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/PartChanges.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Footprint rotation is in radians? Seriously?</li>
<li>No way to edit text in layout</li>
<li>Can't put text on a copper layer</li>
<li>Tooltips can really get in your way (a problem when you're zoomed in on a layout)</li>
<li>Orders allow negative qty all the way up until order submission</li>
<li><strong>Credit card details are saved without any permission (not okay!)</strong></li>
<li>What's with the project urls? http://upverter.com/GeorgeHahn/<strong>3d6ead6de4b3dbee</strong>/MicroUSB-Breakout-Board/</li>
</ul>

<h1>Circuits.IO</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Footprint creation is <s>clunky</s> terrifying</strong> (bad enough I didn't even try to finish making my part).</li>
<li>On the schematic symbol editor (http://www.circuits.io/schematic_symbols/1202/edit), the user as asked to enter a 'coma-separated list' <strong>comma</strong>.</li>
<li>Schematic symbol page shows a hex number for the user: <code>#&lt;User:0x00000009b39c60</code>></li>
