        <span>posted on 02 May 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Intro to Engineering courses are a necessity.</p>

<p>Most Intro to Engineering courses are useless.</p>

<p>Intro to Engineering courses exist to help engineering students get a job after college; to help students bridge the gap between academia and a career. The problem with these intro courses is that they can't evolve quickly enough. Engineering is changing, but the courses haven't caught up.</p>

<p>Now, here's how we can fix them:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stop using the old textbooks.</strong> I don't care who wrote it or when it was written, an Intro to Engineering course shouldn't focus on one text.</li>
<li><strong>Start using social media.</strong> Assignment idea: Have students contact someone in the industry that they respect with as many questions as they can fit within a tweet. Of course, allow those without Twitter accounts to attempt an email contact.
<ul>
<li><strong>Contacts are everything</strong>, right? Teach students how contacts are made in the modern world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Industry mags and blog posts from experts are important.</strong> If a class must contain 'summarize and respond' assignments, let students pick articles or posts they care about. The quality of their responses will instantly improve. </li>
<li><strong>Presentations are important, powerpoint is not.</strong> Don't put artificial slide count requirements on presentations, this only reduces the number of good slides in a presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on solo presentations.</strong> There are times when presentations must be given as a group. Even so, when learning public speaking, working as a group can be extremely stressful and provides little return. Don't force students to work with a group, especially on their first few presentations.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>PS: I'll write a post detailing what was wrong with the Intro to Engineering course that I took later on. I am publishing this post first because I'd rather focus on things that can be improved rather than rag on things that are broken.</em></p>

      <p>Yesterday, I replaced the LMDE entries in my sources.list with entries for Debian Testing. Then I ran a dist-upgrade.</p>

<pre><code>685 upgraded, 10 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 581 MB of archives.
After this operation, 32.8 MB disk space will be freed.

<p>I'm not sure exactly how long the process took, but it was done within a couple hours. When I came back to my laptop, all text was invisible. This problem went away after a reboot.</p>

<p>I haven't removed all installed mint packages yet, and I plan to stay with Cinnamon. As such, everything feels quite the same. In fact, I'd have a hard time pointing out any changes at all. The only significant thing I've gained from this endeavor is the knowledge that my packages will now be more up to date. </p>

      <p>Linux Mint Debian Edition is built on Debian Testing. After months of dealing with flaky mirrors and a not-so-impressive distro, I decided it was time to flip the switch. (Other than Cinnamon and/or MATE, Mint doesn't offer much.)</p>

<p>I am going to attempt to perform an in-place switch by modifying my sources.list. We'll see how it turns out - either it will work, or I'll be installing Debian Testing later tonight.</p>

<p>I generated a new sources.list from <a href="http://debgen.simplylinux.ch/">http://debgen.simplylinux.ch/</a>.</p>

<p>Old sources.list:</p>

      <p><a href="http://upverter.com/">Upverter</a> is the best online circuit creation platform, and OSHPark is one of the best circuit board production services. Put the two together, and you should find bliss - but you won't. Anyone who has had an Upverter-designed board built by OSHPark will be familiar with this problem. When you download gerbers from Upverter, you get a zip full of files like bottom<em>copper.ger and top</em>paste.ger. OSHPark, on the other hand, wants names like Bottom Layer.ger and Board Outline.ger.</p>

<p>Here are the name transformations - each pair consists of the Upverter name followed by the OSHPark name. If a file isn't listed here, it should not be uploaded to OSHPark.</p>

<pre><code>var filepairs = new TupleList&lt;string, string&gt;
{
 { "layers.cfg", "layers.cfg" },
 { "hole.ger", "Drills.xln" },
 { "mechanical_details.ger", "Board Outline.ger" },

 { "top_copper.ger", "Top Layer.ger" },
 { "top_silkscreen.ger", "Top Silk Screen.ger" },
 { "top_solder_mask.ger", "Top Solder Mask.ger" },

 { "bottom_copper.ger", "Bottom Layer.ger" },
 { "bottom_silkscreen.ger", "Bottom Silk Screen.ger" },
 { "bottom_solder_mask.ger", "Bottom Solder Mask.ger" }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote a quick C# command line app to do the transformation automatically. If you drop a Upverter zip onto the app, it will create an <em>osh_</em> zipfile using the OSHPark naming conventions.</p>

<p>You can find the source and the binary at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/George_Hahn/upvertertooshpark">https://bitbucket.org/George_Hahn/upvertertooshpark</a>.</p>

<p>BONUS: Create a shortcut to the binary in the <code>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo</code> directory! This will allow you to right click on an Upverter zip and choose Send to: OSHPark!</p>

        <span>posted on 03 Mar 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>This is an assignment I wrote for my "Intro to Engineering" class. </p>

<h2>Reflection: Important Roles for Professors</h2>

<p>I disagree with three of seven items shown on the list of important roles for professors. Here's what I disagree with and why.</p>

<p><em>Give you the benefit of the doubt on a borderline grade</em></p>

<p>I am a student, not a case for charity. If my professor feels I deserve the higher of two grades, fine, I'll take it, and I'll appreciate it. In the end, though, I really don't care what they do. All I value is that my grade represents an objective view of my proficiency in a subject and the effort I put in. If a professor grades hard, that's not an issue with the professor, that's an issue with my proficiency.</p>

<p><em>Monitor your progress and hold you accountable for your performance</em></p>

<p>I am a student, I can take care of myself. I don't need a figure of responsibility to hold my hand throughout the learning process. Like I said before, all I ask from my professors is that my grade be representative of my skill in the subject they are teaching.</p>

<p><em>Nominate you for scholarships or academic awards</em></p>

<p>I am a student, I have to pay for my own schooling. Applying for scholarship and other excellence-based awards is my job, not my professors'.</p>

<p>Now that I am thoroughly offended by this list, I suppose I might share the four things I do appreciate from a professor. <em>Provide you with invaluable one-on-one instruction. Give you academic advising, career guidance, <s>and personal advice</s>. <s>Help you find a summer job in industry and even</s> hire you on their research grants. Serve as a valuable reference when you apply for jobs, either while you are a student or after you graduate. Perhaps I was wrong to claim I agreed with four of the items. Two and two halves is more accurate.</em></p>

      <p>Late last month, I designed a simple micro USB breakout board on Upverter. I would have bought Sparkfun's breakout, but it does not expose the ID pin - which I needed. I ordered the tiny PCB from OSH Park, but the design <a href="http://upverter.com/GeorgeHahn/3d6ead6de4b3dbee/MicroUSB-Breakout-Board/">is available here</a> for anyone who wants to have it built themselves. Note that you'll need to rename the gerbers from Upverter's naming scheme to OSH Park's.</p>

<p><img src="/images/usb_breakout.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since I have a number of micro USB connectors and some extra boards, I decided to list the board on Tindie. If you happen to need a Micro USB connector with all of the pins broken out, you know where to get it! Since you're awesome and read this post, here's a discount code for $1.00 off: ADF6EE7.

      <p>Some little annoyances I came up with as I was drawing out a simple Micro USB breakout board.</p>

<h1>Upverter</h1>

<ul>
<li>A layout measurement tool would help while drawing part footprints</li>
<li>Can't set default part prefix when creating/editing a part</li>
<li>The part update notification is great, but could use some ironing</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/PartChanges.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Footprint rotation is in radians? Seriously?</li>
<li>No way to edit text in layout</li>
<li>Can't put text on a copper layer</li>
<li>Tooltips can really get in your way (a problem when you're zoomed in on a layout)</li>
<li>Orders allow negative qty all the way up until order submission</li>
<li><strong>Credit card details are saved without any permission (not okay!)</strong></li>
<li>What's with the project urls? http://upverter.com/GeorgeHahn/<strong>3d6ead6de4b3dbee</strong>/MicroUSB-Breakout-Board/</li>
</ul>

<h1>Circuits.IO</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Footprint creation is <s>clunky</s> terrifying</strong> (bad enough I didn't even try to finish making my part).</li>
<li>On the schematic symbol editor (http://www.circuits.io/schematic_symbols/1202/edit), the user as asked to enter a 'coma-separated list' <strong>comma</strong>.</li>
<li>Schematic symbol page shows a hex number for the user: <code>#&lt;User:0x00000009b39c60</code>></li>

        <a href="/2013/01/ugly-duck-model-binding-in-nancy.html">Ugly Duck Model Binding in Nancy</a> 
        <span>posted on 27 Jan 2013</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>It's been a while since I last wrote about my pet web development project. I have made a couple large changes - most importantly, I am now using RavenDB. The second big change is that I have begun dual booting Windows 8 as my development system. While running Windows in a VM is enough to get into Visual Studio, the little pauses began to drive me crazy. I went out and bought a 240 GB Corsair Force GT and couldn't be happier.</p>

<p>Onto my main reason for writing this post - data binding!</p>

<p>I ran into an issue when attempting to bind a HTTP POST to a complex type. The type I was attempting to bind to was <em>QuestionModel</em>, as defined below.</p>

<pre><code>public class QuestionModel
{
 public string Question;
 public List&lt;AnswerModel&gt; Answers;
 public int CorrectAnswer;
 public string Section;
}

public class AnswerModel
{
 public int Id;
 public ChemicalModel ChemicalModel;
}

public class ChemicalModel
{
 public string SMILESString;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Binding to the base <em>QuestionModel</em> variables was no problem, <em>this.Bind<QuestionModel>()</em> worked great. The problem came about in binding to the <em>List of AnswerModels</em> - namely, in that binding simply didn't happen. After a lot of searching, I came across a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11649385/nancy-model-binding-to-child-class">StackOverflow post</a> regarding binding to types with complex children. It looks like the proper way to handle this situation is to write a custom model binder. One alternative I did not investigate was POSTing a JSON object.</p>

<p>Rather than do things the right way, I chose to apply some ugly duck tape.</p>

<pre><code>Post["/add"] = o =&gt;
 {
  // Doesn't bind much
  var question = this.Bind&lt;QuestionModel&gt;();

  // Bind the rest
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) // Bind a max of 20 children
  {
   bool hitSomething = false;
   if (Request.Form["Answers[" + i + "].AnswerString"] != null) // Bind the AnswerString property
   {
    while (question.Answers.Count &lt;= i) // If the index doesn't exist yet, create it and every index before
     question.Answers.Add(new AnswerModel());
    question.Answers[i].AnswerString = Request.Form["Answers[" + i + "].AnswerString"];
    hitSomething = true;
   }

   if (Request.Form["Answers[" + i + "].SMILESString"] != null) // Bind the SMILESString property
   {
    while (question.Answers.Count &lt; i - 1)
     question.Answers.Add(new AnswerModel());
    question.Answers[i].ChemicalModel =
     new ChemicalModel(Request.Form["Answers[" + i + "].SMILESString"]);
    hitSomething = true;
   }
   if (!hitSomething)
    break;
  }

  DocumentSession.Store(question);
  DocumentSession.SaveChanges();

  Model.question = question;
  return View["ShowQuestion", Model];
 };
</code></pre>

<p>This is going to come back to bite me shortly, but it is adequate for the time being. I suppose the moral of the story today is that if you find yourself needing a model binder that is capable of binding to array-indexed names, bother me - hopefully I'll have written it by the time you read this. </p>

<p>There are currently two big players in the online <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation">EDA</a> space. Let's put them side by side and see which one comes out on top!</p>

<h1>General Features</h1>

<p><img src="/images/UpverterAddComponent.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Upverter gives detailed part information during selection</em></p>

<h3>Upverter</h3>

<ul>
<li>Octopart integration</li>
<li>Bill of materials with pricing through Octopart</li>
<li>GitHub integration</li>
<li>Open format files - export to KiCad, gEDA, Fritzing, Eagle, and more.</li>
<li>Circuit import</li>
<li>All changes are recorded</li>
<li>Custom comment system</li>
<li>Said to have simulation capability; was unable to get it to work</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/CircuitIOAddComponent.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Circuits.io gives a brief summary of each part</em></p>

<h3>Circuits.io</h3>

<ul>
<li>Octopart integration</li>
<li>Bill of materials with pricing through Octopart</li>
<li>Excellent tutorial videos</li>
<li>Comments powered by DISQUS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Winner: Upverter</h2>

<p>While both applications show part information from Octopart, Upverter's implementation is much more seamless. There is rarely a time where one must visit the Octopart website for additional information. Combined with their powerful open source import/export library, Upverter easily takes the crown for general features. Both apps have good BOM (bill of materials) and commenting implementations. It is worth noting that Circuit.io's comments are powered by DISQUS, and - as usual - they feel like glued on third party controls.</p>

<h1>Schematic Capture</h1>

<p><img src="/images/CircuitIOAlignment.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Circuit.io's part alignment feature</em></p>

<h3>Circuits.io</h3>

<ul>
<li>Innovative part alignment feature</li>
<li>Generic parts</li>
<li>Can't manually place wires</li>
<li>Can't graphically place signal lines</li>
<li>Cannot change component reference description (particularly annoying because part prefixes cannot be changed without creating a new device)</li>
<li>No visible grid</li>
<li>Parts are zero indexed with no way to change</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upverter</h3>

<ul>
<li>Multiple selection</li>
<li>Visible grid</li>
<li>Can edit reference descriptions</li>
<li>Substandard search tool</li>
</ul>

<h2>Winner: Upverter</h2>

<p>With multiple part selection and a visible grid, drawing a circuit in Upverter feels identical to drawing a circuit in a desktop EDA application. Circuits.io departs from the feel of traditional EDA applications, but does so in a very intuitive way. I was particularly impressed with their part alignment tool - something I've enjoyed in GUI designers in the past. The problem with Circuit.io's schematic capture is that expected features like part editing were nowhere to be found. Another big pet peeve of mine was that signal wires could not be moved manually. While I love the idea of having one less thing to worry about, I quickly found myself tweaking the placement of parts just to make the wires look less tangled. Both tools have a lot of potential, but they are going to need some features before they will be usable in larger designs - for example, neither has a way to define a bus with multiple signal wires.</p>

<h1>Circuit Board Layout</h1>

<p><img src="/images/UpverterLayout.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Test layout from Upverter</em></p>

<h3>Upverter</h3>

<ul>
<li>Multiple selection</li>
<li>Visible grid w/ snapping</li>
<li>Custom grid sizes</li>
<li>Custom vias</li>
<li>Doesn't give a list of premade packages for all parts</li>
<li>Polyfills are complicated to use (I had to ask Upverter support how to use them. Apparently this tool was launched recently, so we can expect improvements soon.)</li>
<li>Had some trouble with generic parts - could not add a footprint for the built-in BJTs</li>
<li>Cannot restore deleted reference descriptor text</li>
<li>Added text size cannot be changed</li>
<li>Part alignment marks are visually intrusive</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/CircuitsIOLayout.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Test layout from Circuits.io</em></p>

<h3>Circuits.io</h3>

<ul>
<li>Excellent part alignment tool</li>
<li>Polyfills are easy to create and are awesome by default</li>
<li>Gives a list of available packages for all parts</li>
<li>Keeps all text facing the same direction</li>
<li>Circuit board outline can be dragged around
Test layout from Circuits.io</li>
<li>Initial rat's nest creation is very tedious - parts are stacked on top of each other and can be hard to select (and easy to create traces when attempting to drag)</li>
<li>No apparent way to add text labels</li>
<li>Traces are hard to delete (select trace, press escape, press delete)</li>
<li>Dragging components attempts to keep traces intact. Cute, but often painful.</li>
<li>Trace widths cannot be changed on the fly</li>
<li>No way to view net names</li>
</ul>

<h2>Winner: Circuits.io</h2>

<p>Circuits.io has a clear lead in circuit board layout. Their friendly part alignment tool is present, along with an intuitive implementation of polyfills (for ground planes, etc). The most glaring issue with both tools was trace placement - traces are universally troublesome to place, move, and tear up. Circuits.io was slightly worse in this regard - to tear up a trace, one must select it, press ESC to cancel drawing a new trace, and then press delete. To be competitive with desktop based layout tools, both websites will need significant work in this area.</p>

<h1>Platform</h1>

<h3>Circuits.io</h3>

<ul>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Funding</li>
<li>Sharing</li>
<li>Manufacturing (PCBs only)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upverter</h3>

<ul>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Sharing</li>
<li>Manufacturing (PCBs only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Winner: Circuits.io</h2>

<p>This is a category where web applications really start to show their power. With collaboration and sharing built in from the start, both websites are natural choices for open source hardware. Circuits.io has an advantage in their choice of business model - they are building a manufacturing and funding platform that will enable hobbyists and help fund further development. On the other hand, Upverter's business model is largely centered around people and businesses paying for private design slots and simulation CPU cycles. While their tool is passable for hobbyist use, they are far from a state where they can compete with desktop based tools. Upverter also provides PCB manufacturing facilities, but it feels like a second class feature.</p>

<h1>Overall Winner: Circuits.io</h1>

<p>Both tools are equally usable and both have their share of annoyances and shortcomings. While it is hard to pick one based on features alone, Circuits.io is an easy choice when the overall platform is considered. Circuits.io currently has a more solid business model than Upverter. Even so, that could change overnight if, for example, Upverter joined up with Tindie as a funding and commerce platform.</p>

<p>To get familiar with each application, I drew a simple 2 transistor LED blinker circuit. I kept the circuit layout single sided. Due to the design of the circuit, a trace must either cross between leads on a component or move to a second signal plane. In both layouts, I routed this trace between the pins of a SOT23 transistor - this goes against best practices, so I would warn against manufacture of either design.</p>

<p>I drew this out a few years ago. The design is all wrong, but I like the concept. </p>
