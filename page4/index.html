      <p>Note: I don't know that this will work for you. It builds fine on my system, but <em>gmediarender --list-outputs</em> shows only "Dummy output module (default)". If you have better luck, let me know!</p>

<p>This is a short tutorial for building GMediaRender on Linux Mint Debian Edition.</p>

<p>I used Henner Zeller's <em>gmrender-resurrect</em> project: he has taken the time to add some great features, for example, volume control and seeking support.</p>

<p>You'll want to grab the source for LibUPNP
LibUPNP: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pupnp/files/latest/download">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pupnp/files/latest/download</a></p>

<p>First, extract LibUPNP to an accessible directory</p>

<p>Build it and install the binary to your system directory</p>

<pre><code>cd libupnp-1.6.17
./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Get the source for <em>gmrender-resurrect</em></p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/hzeller/gmrender-resurrect.git
cd gmrender-resurrect
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit configure.in, add "-lm" to CFLAGS (near line 22)</strong></p>

<p>Build and install</p>

<pre><code>./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install  
</code></pre>

<p>The wax didn't stop the plating well enough, so I made the design stand out with a bit of sanding.</p>

<p>My workflow for this sort of project is to start by designing the part my custom piece needs to fit - so I started by designing my phone.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Phone.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once I had a decent model of the phone, I started working on the dock prototype. It didn't take long to realize I would need to print a partial prototype to verify that the micro USB connector fit correctly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012-11-15+18.55.00.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once the micro USB slot was verified, I polished the design - for example, by adding this cable strain relief slot to the base.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Dock.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are three 130mm long x 6.35mm square spaces internal to the base to allow weight to be added mid-print.</p>

<p>I was pretty worried about this working correctly - I had never designed or printed anything that must be paused mid-print. Other than being fairly inconvenient, it worked out great.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012-11-15+19.59.19.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am very happy with how the dock turned out. It's well weighted and everything fits. I am holding off on final assembly (gluing the USB connector in place) until I discover the proper resistor value to put this phone into dock mode. I plan to use a fancy resistor box at work to accomplish this - I should have it done within the week.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://store.sony.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;partNumber=MDRV500DJ#specifications">Sony MDR-V500</a> headphones were marketed as budget DJ headphones. They sound 'good enough' and are extremely durable. Their biggest fault is that they are on-the-ear headphones instead of the more comfortable over-the-ear type. I set out to fix that with a bit of 3D printing.</p>

<p><s><strong>Mod Results</strong></s>
I did not complete this mod.</p>

<p>I neglected to take a 'before' picture, so here's one from someone else:</p>

<p>Modification Process</p>

<p>First, I modeled the two part enclosure in Solidworks. When this was complete, I tweaked the dimensions to allow for pads with a diameter 3cm larger than the original.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sony-mdr-500-progress1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>To install the larger enclosures, the original enclosures must be removed and the drivers extracted.</p>

<p>First, remove the pads and the three screws under them. Carefully remove the foam that is glued over the driver.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sony-mdr-500-progress2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Separate the two halves of the enclosure. Flip the inner half around and remove the driver by twisting it slightly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sony-mdr-500-progress3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once the driver is free, the headphone wires will need to be removed. Grab a soldering iron and remove the wires one at a time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sony-mdr-500-progress4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Cut the zip tie inside and pull the wire out from the enclosure. The enclosure can now be removed from the headband.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sony-mdr-500-progress5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Save the nice rubber strain relief piece for the new enclosure.</p>

      <p>In Cinnamon 1.6, workspaces in the expo can have custom names applied. However, these names are not carried through to the window right click menu (Move to another workspace ->).</p>

<p>Workspace names in the right click menu are set by the workspace-names key in org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences.</p>

        <span>posted on 13 Oct 2012</span>
      </h1> 
      
      <p>Embedded development sits in a remarkably odd position - somewhere between electrical engineering and computer science. It is such an odd position that there isn't even a college degree for it!</p>

<p>There is one big problem with embedded development today - tools. On the electrical engineering side, there are great tools. An electrical design can be created by a group ranging in size from one person to hundreds, and can be thoroughly simulated, tested, and verified before it is built. Software that runs on full computers is in an even better position. Best practices exist for all common tasks; software written in any language can be thoroughly tested. Every iteration of code can be evaluated based on one metric or another - primarily: do the tests pass?</p>

<p>In embedded development, none of this is true. Unit testing is almost unheard of. Whether or not the code "works" is defined by (hopefully) a third party (probably, a fellow developer) putting a device through its paces.</p>

<p>What we need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit testing (Desktop based?)</li>
<li>A way to put code through its paces on a desktop before it is deployed. I'm imagining a tiny package that defines all of a processor's registers so code will compile and run on a desktop. Bonuses would be a system to generate various interrupts and a robust plugin system that would allow for IO.</li>
</ul>

<p>From there, it would be trivial to set up a build server to continuously check the code in a repository.</p>

<p><em>Sorry for the unpolished post. Better early than never!</em></p>

      <p>A friend asked what got my attention at Maker Faire. My response:</p>

<p>Everything on the Make Live stage was amazing. Intel's futurist, Brian David Johnson, had a very interesting talk. The makerspace panel was absolutely stunning; life changing, even.</p>

<p>I was super impressed by the Rostock Max printer (<a href="http://www.seemecnc.com/">www.SeeMeCNC.com</a>). (re)Designed by a bunch of injection molding guys. They'll be shipping kits of the hard-to-print parts alongside their full kits. These guys had a really neat injection molded business card! I'll post pictures soon.</p>

<p>Trinity Labs (<a href="http://www.trinitylabs.com/">www.trinitylabs.com</a>) is absolutely AMAZING. They have Mike Payson (maxbots), Triffid Hunter, and Arthur Wolf on the payroll. They're moving forward on the excellent Smoothieboard, and have a very sturdy MendelMax offering. Think: single linear motion extrusion on the y axis rather than a pair. Eric took a lot of time to talk to me; it was pretty cool to connect over our plans to build Rostocks.</p>

<p>Listened (and asked a lot of questions) to Edward P. Ryan (<a href="http://www.tb-iplaw.com/">www.tb-iplaw.com</a>), a patent attorney. He was great, and gave me a few good bits of information that I didn't know before. For example, if you create a PCB that, once populated, will infringe upon a patent, selling the bare PCB puts you at risk for a suit.</p>

<p>Qu-Bd (<a href="http://www.qu-bd.com/">http://www.qu-bd.com/</a>) gave me a few feet of their 'nanolinks' mini cable chain. At $3/foot, it's awesome and affordable!</p>

<p>I enjoyed seeing the DLP resin printers. Stunning resolution, but the cured plastic isn't very rigid. It's also best in one color - red - because they're using visible-color (blue?) curing plastic. I think I'll wait until someone's built a specialized UV projector.</p>

<p>iDigi gave me a business card with a bare XBee board. If I can find a BOM, I'm going to populate it ;)</p>

<p>The Shopbot tools on display were impressive - they had a CNC-lathe combo on display! I wouldn't want one for the house, but would definitely reccomend to otherse.</p>

<p>I glanced the Helios Robot (<a href="http://kick.st/Spjaw0">http://kick.st/Spjaw0</a>). Looked like an interesting toy.</p>

<p>I enjoyed seeing the AeroQuad (<a href="http://www.aeroquad.com/">www.AeroQuad.com</a>) multicopters buzzing about all day. They also have very impressive business cards (as much as a paper business card can be impressive).</p>

      <p>NJIT High School Programming Contest Practice Problems
Came across some practice problems from the NJIT High School Programming Contest I attended three years ago, thought I'd share.</p>

<h2>Practice Problem 1</h2>

<p>Write a program that reads a line containing one or more positive integers and prints out the even numbers.</p>

<p>The input is a first line containing one or more positive integers. The output is a single line with each of the even numbers, appearing in the same order as the input.</p>

<p>For example, if the input is</p>

<p>77 2046 91 3 405981 378 22228</p>

<p>then the correct output is</p>

<p>2046 378 22228</p>

<h2>Practice Problem 2</h2>

<p>Write a program that reads a line containing one or more strings and prints out the strings on a single line with each lower canse letter changed to an upper case and each upper case letter changed to lower case.</p>

<p>For example, if the input is</p>

<p>New Jersey</p>

<p>then the correct output is</p>

<p>nEW jERSEY</p>

<h2>Practice Problem 3</h2>

<p>Write a program that determines the subset of a list of words that start with a given letter.</p>

<p>The input is a first line containing a positive integer n and a single letter c. There are n subsequent lines, each containing a word. The output is the number of words that start with c, followed by a list of those words.</p>

<p>For example, if the input is</p>

<p>4 d
cat
dog
rabbit
donkey</p>

<p>then the correct output is</p>

<p>2
dog
donkey</p>
